# LU Decomposition 

## AIM:
To write a program to find the LU Decomposition of a matrix.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware ‚Äì PCs
2. Anaconda ‚Äì Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
(i) To find the L and U matrix
1. The user is prompted to enter a matrix in the form of a nested list. 
2. The lu function performs LU decomposition with partial pivoting.
ùëÉ Permutation matrix (to reorder rows for numerical stability).
ùêø Lower triangular matrix (with ones on the diagonal).
ùëà Upper triangular matrix.
3. The L and U matrices are printed to the console.
4. End of the program
(ii) To find the LU Decomposition of a matrix
1.  A square matrix representing coefficients of the linear equations. A column vector representing the right-hand side of the equations.
2.  LU Factorization: lu_factor(A) performs an LU decomposition with partial pivoting, returning:
    piv: A pivoting information array.
3.Solving Ax=b. lu_solve((lu, piv), b) solves the equation efficiently using the LU decomposition.
4.End of the porgram
